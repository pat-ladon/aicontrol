1,"User Access Provisioning","R-AM-01",Active,"IT Operations","Risk of unauthorized access being granted due to improper user account creation.","All new user accounts for corporate systems must be requested via a formal service desk ticket and require line manager approval before creation by IT Operations."
2,"Timely Account De-provisioning","R-AM-02",Active,"HR/IT","Risk of former employees retaining access to sensitive systems, leading to potential data breaches.","Upon employee termination, HR systems automatically trigger a de-provisioning task. All critical system access must be revoked within 24 hours of termination notification."
3,"Quarterly User Access Reviews","R-AM-03",In Review,"System Owners","Risk of 'privilege creep' where users accumulate excessive access rights over time.","System owners are required to review all user accounts and their permissions for their respective systems on a quarterly basis. A record of this review, including approvals and revocations, is maintained."
4,"Privileged Access Management (PAM)","R-AM-04",Implemented,"Security Team","Risk of misuse or compromise of administrator-level accounts, leading to significant system impact.","All administrative access to production servers requires checkout from a Privileged Access Management (PAM) vault. Sessions are recorded and require a valid ticket number for justification."
5,"Password Complexity and Lifecycle Policy","R-AM-05",Active,"Security Team","Risk of account compromise through weak, reused, or easily guessable passwords.","All user passwords must be a minimum of 14 characters and include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters. Password history is enforced to prevent reuse of the last 12 passwords."
6,"Formal Change Management Process","R-CM-01",Active,"DevOps Team","Risk of service disruption or security vulnerabilities introduced by unauthorized or untested changes to production systems.","All changes to production infrastructure and applications must follow a documented change management process, including peer review, testing, and approval by a Change Advisory Board (CAB)."
7,"Segregation of Duties in Development","R-CM-02",Active,"Engineering","Risk of a single developer introducing and deploying malicious or flawed code without oversight.","The developer who writes code is not permitted to be the one who deploys it to the production environment. Deployments require a separate approver from the Operations team."
8,"Vulnerability Scanning and Remediation","R-VM-01",Active,"Security Team","Risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities in system software.","Production systems are scanned for vulnerabilities on a monthly basis. Critical and High vulnerabilities must be remediated within 30 and 90 days, respectively, as per the SLA."
9,"Server Patch Management","R-VM-02",Active,"IT Operations","Risk of system compromise due to unpatched operating systems or third-party software.","Critical security patches for all production servers must be applied within 30 days of release by the vendor."
10,"Data Encryption in Transit","R-DP-01",Implemented,"Network Team","Risk of data interception and theft as it moves across internal or external networks.","All network traffic transmitting sensitive data, both internally and externally, must be encrypted using strong, industry-standard protocols such as TLS 1.2 or higher."
11,"Data Encryption at Rest","R-DP-02",Implemented,"Database Admins","Risk of data exposure if physical storage media (disks, backups) are stolen or improperly accessed.","All production databases and object storage containing customer or sensitive corporate data are encrypted at rest using AES-256."
12,"Data Backup and Recovery Testing","R-DP-03",Active,"IT Operations","Risk of significant data loss and extended downtime in the event of a system failure, corruption, or ransomware attack.","All critical production data is backed up daily. Full data recovery procedures are tested on an annual basis to ensure data integrity and verify recovery time objectives (RTO)."
13,"Secure Configuration Baselines (Hardening)","R-IO-01",Active,"Security Team","Risk of system compromise due to default, weak, or insecure system configurations.","All servers and network devices are hardened using documented configuration baselines based on CIS (Center for Internet Security) benchmarks before being deployed into production."
14,"Centralized Logging and Monitoring","R-IM-01",Active,"Security Team","Risk of security incidents going undetected, leading to delayed response and greater impact.","Logs from all critical systems, applications, and network devices are forwarded to a centralized SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system. Automated alerts are configured for suspicious activities."
15,"Incident Response Plan and Testing","R-IM-02",Active,"Security Team","Risk of a chaotic and ineffective response during a security incident, increasing damage and recovery time.","A formal Incident Response plan is maintained and reviewed annually. A tabletop exercise simulating a major security incident is conducted at least once a year with key stakeholders."
