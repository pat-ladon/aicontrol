# GRC Co-pilot Central Guidance

## Hallmarks of a High-Quality Assessment
- **Specificity:** Use numbers and proper nouns. Instead of "access is reviewed periodically," write "User access to the 'SAP Finance' application is reviewed quarterly by line managers."
- **Clarity:** Write for a non-technical auditor. Avoid jargon.
- **Evidence-Based:** Always link your statements to tangible evidence. Instead of "backups are performed," write "Daily incremental backups are performed, with completion status logged to the 'Veeam Backup & Replication' console."

## Common Reviewer Questions to Pre-emptively Answer
- How do you know the control is operating continuously? (Answer with monitoring/logging details)
- What is the process for handling exceptions? (Describe the exception handling workflow)
- Who is responsible for this control? (Name the specific role, e.g., "System Owner")

## Examples of Excellent Rephrasing
- **Weak:** "we check the firewall rules"
- **Strong:** "Firewall rule sets are reviewed on a monthly basis to ensure they align with the corporate security policy and deny all traffic by default."
